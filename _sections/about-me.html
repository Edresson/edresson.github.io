<p>I'm a 2st year Ph.D student in computer science at the <a href="https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/">Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences (ICMC)</a>, University of São Paulo (USP).</p>

<p>Recently, I'm a member of <a href="http://www.nilc.icmc.usp.br/">NILC</a> (Interinstitutional Center for Computational Linguistics), a renowned NLP Research group in Brazil and I participate in R&D projects in Speech at  <a href="http://centrodeia.org/">CEIA</a> (Center of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence)
</p> 
<p>I took my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Technology_%E2%80%93_Paran%C3%A1">Federal University of Technology – Paraná</a>. 
I started to learn about ML and NLP for my final project, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=tT_zTwgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao"> Arnaldo Candido Junior </a>. 
As a result, I created and made available <a href="https://github.com/Edresson/TTS-Portuguese-Corpus">a dataset for speech synthesis in Brazilian Portuguese</a>, and developed a <a href="https://github.com/Edresson/TTS-Portuguese-Corpus"> Speech synthesizer (TTS) </a> for the Brazilian Portuguese publicly available. </p>
